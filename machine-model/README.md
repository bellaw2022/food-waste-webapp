# Clip Model with Faiss

For the frontend, just run npm install and then npm start, and it should start up.

For the backend, I’ve written a README in the backend folder, and it should only take two steps to get it running.

Once everything is running, you’ll be able to see the functionality: when you click 'scan,' the image in the box will be sent to the backend, and the backend will return the results. After clicking 'scan,' the camera view on the frontend will freeze until the user clicks 'scan' again. Please follow this logic to integrate it into our UI.
