git clone https://github.com/bellaw2022/food-waste-webapp.git
```
```bash
cd food-waste-webapp
```
### 1.2 Environment Variables
You will need to create a `.env` file in the backend directory of the project, plz reach out to get the file. 


### 2. Backend Setup (Flask)

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
In the `flask-backend` directory, set up a virtual environment:
```bash
cd flask-backend
python3 -m venv venv
```
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
```


```bash
use `venv\Scripts\activate` # For Windows
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 3: Running the Backend Server
Once the environment is ready, you can run the Flask server:
```bash
flask run
```
The backend will run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

### 3. Frontend Setup (React)
### Step 1: Navigate to the Frontend Directory
```bash
cd ../fridgify-frontend
```
### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the necessary React dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
### Step 3: Running the Frontend
